# re-refresh

Steo 1:
Download the ZIP.

Step 2:
Extract the ZIP.

Step 3:
Open chrome 
Navigate to Manage extensions
turn on developer mode and click on Load unpacked button.

Step 4:
Select the extracted folder.

(If youre using incognito, enable it. i would recommend you to use normal window.)

Thats it. now your error page should auto reload until it returns.


NOTE: It just auto refreshes the error page, instead of refreshing manually. please watch the screen continously and comply with all the other protocols.
if err=true appears in URL, it might mean that your OFC booking has failed due to whatever reason. you will not get consular if you proceed to refresh, at this point. so remove "?err=true" from url and retry again. you will have to select OFC again.
